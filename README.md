# Examination of Global Earth Surface Temperatures

## Objective
This project aims to explore the change in surface temperature data from around the globe sectioned out by global, country, state and by cities over the course of roughly 250 years and examine potential future surface temperatures if trends continue.

## Data set
This data set comes from a Kaggle data set which can be found here. The data set is a repackaged compilation of a data set curated by Berkely Earth, a US based non-profit organization, that was founded in 2010. Berkeley Earth started this data set to address what were at the time of their founding criticisms of climate change. The data represent earth surface temperature data going back as far as 1750. It contains roughly 1.6 billion records and is partitioned into global, country, state and county averages with between 4-12 fields depending on partition. There is some missing data, as not all regions have been recording temperatures for as long as others, apart from that all the cleaning has taken place and no further data cleaning is required.
